#for loops = execute a block of code a fized number of times.
#            can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.

# for x in range(1,11): #(start,end,step)
#     print(x)

# for x in reversed(range(1,11)):
#     print(x)

# for x in range(1,21):
#     if x == 13:
#         continue #skip the iteration (13)
#         break #stop when the iteration (13)
#     else:
#         print(x)
